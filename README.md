# DKNightVersion

DKNightVersion is a light weight framework. It's mainly built through `objc/runtime` library and reflection, providing a neat approach  adding night mode to your iOS app. A great many codes of this framework is automatically generated by Ruby script.

The most delightful feature of DKNightVersion is that it appends one more property `nightColor` to frequently-used UIKit components and provides you a default night mode theme. It is easily-used and well-designed. Hope you have a great joy to use DKNightVersion to integrate night mode in your Apps.

# How to use

## Using night color

DKNightVersion is based on property `nightColor`, such as `nightBackgroundColor` `nightTextColor` and etc.

Assign the night mode color you want to the `UIKit` component like this:

```
self.view.nightBackgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
self.label.nightTextColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
```

## Using DKNightVersionManager change theme

Use `DKNightVersionManager` sets the theme.

```
[DKNightVersionManager nightFalling];
```

If you'd like to switch back to normal mode:

```
[DKNightVersionManager dawnComing];
```

It's pretty easy to swich theme between night and normal mode.

## Make your own customize

### Notification

`nightFalling` method will post `DKNightVersionNightFallingNotification` when it is called. Similarly, `dawnComing` will post `DKNightVersionDawnComingNotification`. You can observe these notification in proper place, and make your own customize easily.

### JSON

There is a json file in `Generator` folder named `property.json`, you can change the color in it, which will cuz the default color changing to the color you want.

```
{
    "UIView": 
    { 
        "backgroundColor": "0x343434",
        "tintColor": "0xffffff"
    },
    "UILabel":
    {
        "textColor": "0x5d5d5d"
    },
    "UINavigationBar":
    {
        "barTintColor": "0x444444"
    },
    "UIButton":
    {
        "titleColor": "0x5F80AC"
    },
    "UIScrollView":
    {
        "backgroundColor": "0x343434"
    },
    "UITableView":
    {
        "backgroundColor": "0x343434",
        "separatorColor": "0x313131"
    },
    "UITableViewCell":
    {
        "backgroundColor": "0x343434" 
    } 
}
```

And run `rake` in terminal under folder `Pods/DKNightVersion`.

This command will automatically do everything for you.

## Using default night version

If you set `useDefaultNightColor` property for singleton manager to `YES`, which is the default value. DKNightVersion will provide you a default night mode. 

And you can also customize the color through assign color value to `nightColor` property. And we will first pick color you specified instead of default behavior.

Optionally, turn off the default night mode and set it on your own is also supported.

```
[DKNightVersionManager setUseDefaultNightColor:NO];
```

## Picking Color

DKNightVersionManager will pick the proper color following these two rules.

1. `useDefaultNightColor == YES` (The default behavior)

		nightColor > defaultNightColor > normalColor

2. `useDefaultNightColor == NO`

		nightColor > normalColor
